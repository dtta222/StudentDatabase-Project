# StudentDatabase Project

# Description:
The StudentDatabase project is a Java application designed to manage student enrollments and balances for a university. The application prompts the user to input the number of new students to be added to the database. For each student, the user is then prompted to enter their name and year. The system generates a unique 5-digit ID for each student, with the first digit representing their grade level.

Students have the option to enroll in various courses, each costing $600. The application allows students to view their balance and pay tuition. The status of each student, including their name, ID, enrolled courses, and balance, can be displayed.
