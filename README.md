# StudentDatabase Project

# Description:
The StudentDatabase project is a Java application designed to manage student enrollments and balances for a university. The application prompts the user to input the number of new students to be added to the database. For each student, the user is then prompted to enter their name and year. The system generates a unique 5-digit ID for each student, with the first digit representing their grade level.

Students have the option to enroll in various courses, each costing $600. The application allows students to view their balance and pay tuition. The status of each student, including their name, ID, enrolled courses, and balance, can be displayed.

# Tech Used:
- Java
- Object-Oriented Design

# Lessons Learned:
User Input Handling: Gained experience in handling user input and validation, ensuring a smooth and error-free interaction with the application.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Practiced OOP principles by designing a Student class to encapsulate properties and behaviors, promoting code modularity and reusability.

Array Usage: Learned how to use arrays to store and manage multiple instances of the Student class efficiently.

File Organization: Explored effective file organization and documentation practices, including creating separate classes for different functionalities and providing clear comments.

Basic User Interface: Implemented a basic text-based user interface for interacting with the application.# StudentDatabase-Project
